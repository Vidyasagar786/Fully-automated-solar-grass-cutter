# Fully-automated-solar-grass-cutter
The fully automated solar grass cutter is a fully automated grass cutting robotic vehicle powered by solar energy that also avoids obstacles and is capable of fully automated grass cutting without the need of any human interaction. The system uses 6V batteries to power the vehicle movement motors as well as the grass cutter motor. We also use a solar panel to charge the battery so that there is no need of charging it externally. The grass cutter and vehicle motors are interfaced to an 8051 family microcontroller that controls the working of all the motors. It is also interfaced to an ultrasonic sensor for object detection. The microcontroller moves the vehicle motors in forward direction in case no obstacle is detected. On obstacle detection the ultrasonic sensor monitors it and the microcontroller thus stops the grass cuter motor to avoid any damage to the object/human/animal whatever it is. Microcontroller then turns the robotic as long as it gets clear of the object and then moves the grass cutter in forward direction again.
